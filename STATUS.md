## Index

| Cycle | Item | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0000 | bootstrap | Content/environment foundation. |
| 0001–0002 | operator notes | Historical alignment notes; not product cycles. |
| 0003 | M0-figma-file | Initial file setup, merged in PR #1; incomplete acceptance. |
| 0004 | M0 reconciliation | Gate persisted; internal button lookup failed. |
| 0005 | M0 wiring retry | Internal chain repaired; Cover cross-page NAVIGATE failed. |
| 0006 | M0-figma-file | Accepted. Supported Cover link, layouts and modes checked; human gate resolved. |
| 0019 | M4-dorm | Figma and implementation checkpoint; tests/build pass, browser runner blocked. |
| 0018 | M3-escort | Done: saved frames retained, accessible escort and dialogue implemented; all gates passed. M4 held. |
| 0017 | M3-escort | Design receipts saved; facing/accessibility call failed. Human gate, no runtime implementation. |
| 0016 | R3-D2-character-range | Done: visual comparison, targeted frame reconciliation, Handoff and all validation passed. M3 held. |
| 0015 | R3-D2-character-range | Compact request passed input limit; oversized return prevented commit. Human gate. |
| 0014 | R3-D2-character-range | Authentication restored; oversized write rejected before execution. Human gate retained. |
| 0013 | R3-D2-character-range | Resume blocked: Figma UNAUTHORIZED; drafts intact, no product edits. |
| 0012 | R3-D2-character-range | Paused at operator request. Design drafts preserved; Figma inspected, no new range frames or product code. |
| 0011 | R2-D2-preview | Repaired: persistent large figure, skin swatches and visible wardrobe; M3 held. Meta review recorded. |
| 0010 | M2-character | Implemented; saved mobility and colorblind round trip; M3 held. |
| 0009 | R1-D1-arrival | Done. Three-stage ride, explicit ending and replay; M2 held. |
| 0008 | R1-D1-arrival | Blocked on Figma authentication. Repair frames created previously; no repair code shipped. |
| 0007 | M1-letter-train | Done. Local D1 arrival + version-bound feedback; tested build fd13bcf. |

## Current handoff

- M4 checkpoint, incomplete. Figma unpack frames 95:4981 / 95:4995; notice 95:5009 / 95:5026; prototype entry 96:4981; Handoff 97:2. Existing file retained: https://www.figma.com/design/RgmU4XGp5hEYxNTBlvXlOS.
- Added origin-labeled bag, three room doodads with saved slots, explicit Finish settling in and orientation notice. No campus transition. Implementation is not browser accepted.
- Last validate passed 30 unit tests, TypeScript and production build. Browser suite never ran: Node requires a JSON import attribute on content/escort.json when loading the new test's imports. Initial test typing failure and two browser-runner import failures reached LOOP.md's three-failure limit. Stop blocked.
- Resume cycles/0019-dorm-checkpoint.md after clearance. Keep frames; fix module loading, run browser checks, compare room screenshots, then update acceptance. M5 not started. Product count unchanged.

## D1 build

- Tested build: `aa56940b0a0bfb9b046c76dd024ea664a46b2780`. Repair source commit aa56940; later completion metadata does not change the app.
- Local play: `npm ci && npm run validate && npm run preview`; open the local URL printed on port 4173.
- Built files: `dist/index.html` and `dist/feedback/index.html`.
- Feedback: `feedback/index.html?demo=D1-letter-train&version=aa56940b0a0bfb9b046c76dd024ea664a46b2780` (Give feedback fills this automatically).
- Prototype: recorded Figma file → Cover arrival link → Present / Flow 1. D1 repair handoff `47:2`.
- D1 historical cycle: `cycles/0009-D1-repair.md`.

## D2 Character range build

Validated source: `f86981922dc279501d3a06f67c26eabd007ed791`. From the repository run `npm ci && npm run validate && npm run preview`; open the local URL printed on port 4173. Platform → Create your character → Save → feedback/edit/return. Feedback: `feedback/index.html?demo=D2-character&version=f86981922dc279501d3a06f67c26eabd007ed791`; fresh builds bind their checked-out SHA. Built artifacts: dist/index.html and dist/feedback/index.html. No public deployment URL.

Separate portrait and native-grid map sprite, all 52 range controls, retained appearance/access and uninferred optional flags. Final visual comparison accepts the documented native-control, sticky-scroll, sample-state and prototype differences; see Figma Handoff and docs/FIGMA.md. No new positive operator playtest is claimed.
